# KeePass OneDrive Sync

I've created a free plugin for KeePass that allows syncing of multiple password databases from multiple OneDrives to a local version. It allows you to synchronize an unlimited amount of KeePass datbases with an unlimited amount of OneDrives. So i.e. you can synchronize your personal KeePass database with your personal OneDrive and your work related KeePass with a OneDrive that is shared among your colleagues, if you wish.

## Todo

On my todo list are still:

1. Add a OneDrive File browser for easier selection of a location on OneDrive 
2. Allow a KeePass database to be opened directly from OneDrive without the need to download it yourself first

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to Oleksandr Senyuk for making [KeeSkyDrive](http://sourceforge.net/projects/keeskydrive/) as it has inspired me to create this plugin.
