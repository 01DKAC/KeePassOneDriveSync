# KeePass OneDrive Sync

I've created a free plugin for KeePass that allows syncing of multiple password databases from multiple OneDrives to a local version. It allows you to synchronize an unlimited amount of KeePass databases with an unlimited amount of OneDrives. So i.e. you can synchronize your personal KeePass database with your personal OneDrive and your work related KeePass with a OneDrive for Business on Office 365 that is shared among your colleagues, if you wish. This way it's also easy to be able to access your same KeePass database from all of your Windows devices.

## Download ##
You need to download either the DLLs *OR* the PLGX and place it inside your KeePass\Plugins folder (typically C:\Program Files (x86)\KeePass Password Safe 2\Plugins), so not both. I've switched to using the GitHub releases functionality.

## Latest Version

Version 2.0.0.0 - August 25, 2017

- Replaced DLLs in the solution with NuGet package references. This does increase the PLGX file size, but does ease keeping this plugin updated with the latest versions for developers
- Upgraded KoenZomers.OneDrive.Api to v2.0.1.0 which has support for the Microsoft Graph API
- Plugin is now compiled against the Microsoft .NET Framework v4.5.2 as v4.5 is out of support
- Added the option to use the Microsoft Graph API to store the KeePass database on OneDrive or OneDrive for Business. The API will automatically define if it's the Consumer OneDrive or OneDrive for Business based on the login you use. Using the Microsoft Graph API option is now the recommended option.
- Made preparations to support on-premises SharePoint 2013 and 2016 farms as well as synchronizing to a SharePoint TeamSite. This functionality will become available in a future version.
- Fixed issue with not being able to close the database anymore if something would go wrong during a sync attempt (i.e. network not available)

## Todo

On my todo list are still:

1. Support for OneDrive for Business for on premises SharePoint 2013 and SharePoint 2016 farms
2. Support for storing KeePass databases within TeamSites on SharePoint on-premises and SharePoint Online

## Special Thanks

Special thanks to Oleksandr Senyuk for making [KeeSkyDrive](http://sourceforge.net/projects/keeskydrive/) as it has inspired me to create this plugin.
