# KeePass OneDrive Sync

## Configuration options

Under Tools -> OneDrive Sync Options you will find all the KeePass databases that are set up for synchronization through the plugin. Note that the local file path is the key of the configuration for the synchronization. This means that if you would move the locally stored KeePass database, you will have to set up the synchronization with OneDrive again.

In this configuration window you can right click on an entry to get a context menu with options for that specific KeePass database.

I.e. you can choose to delete configuration of KeePass databases you no longer want to synchronize (keyboard shortcut DEL). You can also force a synchronization to happen or view the underlying details of a synchronization as to which OneDrive it is being synced to and to which folder.

You can also choose to view more details on the configuration kept for a KeePass database synchronization (keyboard shortcut ENTER).
